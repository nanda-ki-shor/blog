After a really long gap, I have started blogging again. Here is how this blog is created (how meta!!!)

* [Github][github] Pages hosting the content.
* [Jekyll][jekyll] as the static site generator.
	* [Plainwhite Jekyll theme][theme].
* [Godaddy][godaddy] as the Domain host.
* [Cloudflare][cloudflare] for all the nameservers and origin protection.
* [Disqus][disqus] for all commenting support.
